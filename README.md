This is a starter repo for Next.js + Kinde Auth. It deals with authentication in server components, server actions, client components and roles & permissions.

No guarantees are given that it's coded 100% securely, but it's a good starting point.

## Getting Started

Run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies.

Create a .env file with the environment variables given as an example in .env.example -- after that you can delete the .env.example file.

Run 'npx prisma db push' to create the database and tables.
